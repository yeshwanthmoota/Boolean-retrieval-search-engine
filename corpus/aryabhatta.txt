Aryabhata (Sanskrit: आर्यभट, ISO: Āryabhaṭa) or Aryabhata I[3][4] (476–550 CE)[2][5] was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali Yuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old)[6] and the Arya-siddhanta.

For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.[7]

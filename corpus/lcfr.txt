Lucifer[1] is the name of various figures in folklore associated with the planet Venus. Originally stemming from a son of the personified dawn, the goddess Aurora, in Roman mythology, the entity's name was subsequently absorbed into Christianity as a name for the devil. Modern scholarship generally translates the term in the relevant Bible passage where the Ancient Greek figure's name was historically used (Isaiah 14:12) as "morning star" or "shining one" rather than as a proper name, Lucifer.[2]

As a name for the Devil in Christian theology, the more common meaning in English, "Lucifer" is the rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל‎ (transliteration: hêylêl; pronunciation: hay-lale)[3] in Isaiah[4] given in the King James Version of the Bible. The translators of this version took the word from the Latin Vulgate,[5] which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized),[6][7] meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing".[8]

As a name for the planet in its morning aspect, "Lucifer" (Light-Bringer) is a proper name and is capitalized in English. In Greco-Roman civilization, it was often personified and considered a god[9] and in some versions considered a son of Aurora (the Dawn).[10] A similar name used by the Roman poet Catullus for the planet in its evening aspect is "Noctifer" (Night-Bringer).[11]
